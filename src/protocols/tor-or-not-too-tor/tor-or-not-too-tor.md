# Tor || !2 Tor

## What is Tor?
    Tor is an anonymity/privacy tool, meant to protect your location and identity, which is Free and Open Source.

    The name is derived from an acronym for the original software project name "The Onion Router" - https://www.torproject.org/

    This refers to the way that Tor protects your data by wrapping it in multiple layers of encryption like an onion.

    Tor uses a unique system that was developed by the US Navy to protect government intelligence communications.

## How to install ...
    Visit https://www.torproject.org/download/

     * Download the package for your OS and language.
     * Verify the package.
     * Install the downloaded and verified package.

## How to use ...
    Run the Tor Browser and visit an .onion site - https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/ DuckDuckGo Search engine

    Check if you running Tor - https://check.torproject.org/

## When to use Tor?
    As Tor Browser is an anonymity tool, which blocks tracking and hides some of your details and aims to make all Tor users look the same to average users, Tor Browser could be used to anonymise whistleblowing.

## When not to use Tor?
    Don’t use the Tor Browser if you want an End to End Encryption too a none .onion site like your banking site, as the Exit Node ends encryption and can be intercepted between the Exit Node and the destination server.

## How does Tor Network work?
    Tor data is bundled into layers of encrypted packets before it enters the Tor network. This is routed through a series of volunteer-operated servers called nodes or relays.
    Each time the Tor data passes through one of these relays, a layer of encryption is removed to reveal the location of the next relay. When you reach the final relay on your path, known as the exit node, the last layer of encryption is removed and your data is sent to its final destination.
    Each relay only decrypts enough data to know the location of the previous and next relays. Since each path is randomly generated and none of the relays keep records, it’s nearly impossible for your activity to be traced back to you through Tor’s complex network.

## Notes:
    Anonymity is not Confidentiality

    Tor is not a VPN

    Tor data leaving the Tor network can be intercepted

Advantages:
 * Free and Open Source
 * Supports Linux, OSX and Windows
 * Easy to install for supported OS
 * .onion sites are securely accessible only using Tor Browser
 * Not controlled by Corporation or Government agencies

Disadvantages:
 * Slow
 * Exit Node data is not necessarily encrypted by Tor, can be intercepted
 * Does not stop somebody from deanonymities themselves
 * Does not stop interceptors from knowing you using Tor
 * Tor network not user friendly, due to be secure and hidden nature
 * Nodes (relay/bridge) are run by volunteers
